# Weather Report
This small application was created to take a deeper dive when experimenting with several technologies.
- WPF with the MVVM pattern using the [Caliburn.Micro](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro) framework.
- Boilerplate code for setting up DI (net8-style), in particular for Caliburn.Micro using the [Dapplo.Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting](https://github.com/dapplo/Dapplo.Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting#dapplomicrosoftextensionshostingcaliburnmicro) library
- Unit tests using [AutoFixture](https://autofixture.github.io/docs/quick-start/), AutoMoq and xUnit for injecting the instances of SUTs and their dependencies into the test code.
